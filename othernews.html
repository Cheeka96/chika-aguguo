  <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/northern-california-authorities-arrest-alleged-serial-rapist-231530055.html"> California man arrested for 10 rape cases</a>
  <p> this article to me is intersting because these 10 rape cases happened from 1991-2006. my thing about these cases is why do people wait so long to come forth about someone rapeing them from almost 10 years ago?. like in bill cosbys case, they have women who baned together to accuse him of rape almost 40 years ago and in the name of what? to tarnish his name?. im not saying that it is a good deed to help out with but why would women wait THAT long just to come forward about this?</p>
