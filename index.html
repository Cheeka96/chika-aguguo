  <h3> About me</h3>
  <p> Hello my name is Chika. I created this site because it helps me take on 4 different side that I view everyday. it is comprised of sports, music, and different types of news that we see everyday in life. it also gives me a chance to know how to read into things that I am not used to looking at myself. so while im here to give insight on things that I like to learn, I hope you guys can teach me as well.</p>
