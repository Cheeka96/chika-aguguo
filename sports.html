  <p> the reason this photo means alot is because this it what the steelers are missing this season. the team is now 0-1-1 and it is because this man is not playing as of this very moment. Steelers Running back Le'veon Bell has yet to play a single game this season due to contract negotians and it is hurting the teams chances of having a shot at the super bowl. even with the talent of wide receiver antonio brown, it is still not enough to cap off some wins for the team. If I were the steelers i would pay the man the money he deserves so that they can win games.</p>
